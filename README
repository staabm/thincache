This small cache abstraction layer was built because of the lack of PHP5.2 compilant caching libraries.

Supported features:
- use different backends, each with a dedicated driver.
- unified api across backends.
- proxying a cache driver; for transparent proxying of slow backends.
- chaining several cache drivers; distributes content into using several drivers.
